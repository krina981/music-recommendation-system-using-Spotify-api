# music-recommendation-system-using-Spotify-api
This project is a music recommendations system built using the Spotipy API. It utilizes the power of Spotipy, a Python library for the Spotify Web API, to fetch and analyze music data. The system recommends similar songs or artists based on user preferences and generates a curated playlist for a personalized music experience.

Features
Authentication: The system uses Spotipy's authentication process to securely connect to the Spotify Web API. This allows the retrieval of user-specific data, including playlists, favorite tracks, and more.

User Preferences: Users can input their favorite songs, artists, or genres, which serve as the basis for generating personalized recommendations. The system analyzes these preferences to understand the user's music taste and interests.

Recommendation Generation: Leveraging the Spotipy API, the system applies various recommendation techniques such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid methods to generate song or artist recommendations. These recommendations are based on similarity measures derived from music features such as tempo, energy, danceability, and more.

Playlist Creation: The system allows users to create curated playlists based on the recommendations generated. Users can specify the number of songs they want in the playlist, and the system populates it accordingly.

User Interface: The system provides a user-friendly interface where users can interact with the recommendation system. The interface allows users to input their preferences, view recommended songs/artists, and create playlists effortlessly.

Installation
To run the music recommendations system locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository from GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
